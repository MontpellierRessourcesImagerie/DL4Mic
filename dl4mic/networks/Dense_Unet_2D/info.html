<h2>Image segmentation using Dense U-Net 2D</h2>
<hr>
<!--img-->
<p>
U-Net is an encoder-decoder network architecture originally used for image segmentation, first published by
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597v1">
        Ronneberger et al.</a>. The first half of the U-Net architecture is a downsampling convolutional neural network which
    acts as a feature extractor from input images. The other half upsamples these results and restores an image by
    combining results from downsampling with the upsampled images.
</p>
<p>
    DenseNet is a network architecture which connects each layer to every other layer in a feed-forward fashion, first published by
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.06993v5">
        Gao Huang et al.</a>.
</p>
<p>
    This network is an implementation of a Dense U-Net, an U-Net architecture where each layer is
    densely connected with the other layers of the same downsampling or upsampling step
</p>
<p>
    This particular network enables image segmentation of 2D datasets.
