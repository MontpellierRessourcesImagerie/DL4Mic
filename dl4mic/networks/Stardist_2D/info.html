<h2>Segment Nuclei using StarDist</h2>
<hr>
<!--img-->
<p>
StarDist is a deep-learning method that can be used to segment cell nuclei in 2D (XY) single images or in stacks (XYT), first published by
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03535">
        Uwe Schmidt et al.</a>.
    StarDist predicts object probabilities and star-convex polygons parameterized by the radial distances using a simple U-Net architecture and by selecting the final instances via non-maximum suppression.
