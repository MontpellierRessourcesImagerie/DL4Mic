<h2>Image denoising using Noise2Void 2D</h2>

<p>
U-Net is an encoder-decoder network architecture originally used for image segmentation, first published by
    <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597v1">
        Ronneberger et al.</a>. The first half of the U-Net architecture is a downsampling convolutional neural network which
    acts as a feature extractor from input images. The other half upsamples these results and restores an image by
    combining results from downsampling with the upsampled images.
</p>
<p>
This particular network enables image segmentation of 2D datasets. If you are interested in 3D datasets,
    you should use the 3D U-Net instead.
